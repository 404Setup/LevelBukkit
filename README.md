> I like to try newer things, so I recommend [ShreddedPaper](https://github.com/MultiPaper/ShreddedPaper) to you, which is the next generation of [MultiPaper](https://github.com/MultiPaper/MultiPaper). If you want to be more stable and don't want to put in too much energy, then use [Luminol](https://github.com/LuminolMC/Luminol/blob/ver/1.20.6/README_EN.md) or [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia), I'm leaving.


All of my other projects are going away, and I'm no longer playing Minecraft, but LevelBukkit will continue to exist until I get tired of it.
